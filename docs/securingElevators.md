### Securing Elevators

To secure and make floors public, navigate to the Access Control 
Tab, and click on the “Floor Status” button. This page opens in 
the Floor view. This will show all readers that share that floor,
and the status of the reader for that floor. The status will be 
“Secure”, “Public” or “Unknown”. Secure means the floor requires 
a valid card read to grant access, Public is open (the equivalent
to unlocked), and “Unknown” should the reader be offline.

Elevator floors can be scheduled open by creating an Elevator
Access Level and then assigning that level to the Override 
Elevator Access Level. The Elevator Access Level will dictate 
the schedule and the floors that will be open.

If the Override Elevator Access Level is set to the schedule 
“Always”, the floors selected in the Elevator Access Level will 
automatically become public upon saving the reader settings page 
where the Override Elevator Access Level option resides. 

The reader can then be secured in “Floor Status” by clicking 
the lock button.

The unlock button will set it back to the Override Elevator 
Access Level.

** NOTE: Refresh the “Floor Status” page to see the changes 
take effect.

The reader can also be unlocked in the Hardware Tree by right 
clicking the reader and selecting the “Unlock” option. This 
option will override any other schedules or overrides set in 
Elevator Access Levels.
